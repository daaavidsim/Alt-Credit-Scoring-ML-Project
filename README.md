# Alt-Credit-Scoring-ML-Project

This repository features a machine learning-driven approach to credit risk assessment using the German Credit Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project focuses on building a robust classification model to distinguish between "Good" and "Bad" credit risks, utilizing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and automated model evaluation.
